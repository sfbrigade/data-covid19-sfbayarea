    Scrape official county COVID-related news from Contra Costa County. The
    county's official site does not have RSS, so this scrapes HTML.

    The current content comes from the Health Services Department's updates
    page. Othe potentially relevant sources might include:
    - The county's "news flash" RSS feed (much broader topics than just COVID):
      https://www.contracosta.ca.gov/RSSFeed.aspx?ModID=1&CID=All-newsflash.xml
    - The county's COVID-specific "news flash" page (no RSS for this category
      of news flashes). The formatting of these is not the greatest fit for
      a list of linkable news items.
      https://www.contracosta.ca.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=2180
    - The Health Services Department's "news room."
