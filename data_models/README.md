# The County Data Model
The county data model lives as [_data_model.json](./_data_model.json).  
This is a legal .json file with the standard structure and default values. Note which items are ordered lists/arrays, such as timeseries, and age groups. Note also that default values are set to -1, which represents any data not present (this could show up in the source data as 'null', 'N/A', etc.) Below is a brief walk-through of the model, with links to more details as needed.
1. __Headers__  
Below are the top-level datapoints.
```
{   
    "name": "Name1 Name2 County",  
    "update_time": "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mmz",
    "source_url": "POINT TO LANDING PAGES, IN CASE ENDPOINTS CHANGE", 
    "meta_from_source" : "STORE IMPORTANT NOTES FROM SOURCE HERE",
    "meta_from_baypd": "STORE IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT OUR METHODS HERE",
}
```
   * `name`: The county's full official name, ending in "County", with spaces, in title case. For example, `"San Mateo County"`.  
* `update_time`: A timestamp string in [ISO 8601](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime) format. If no timezone offset is specified, try converting the timestamp from UTC. We'll keep a running list of places to search for timezone info [here](#timezone).
* `source_url`: There may be a few endpoints that you're working with. In case these change, use a data landing page or data directory that's less likely to change. These are called things like "data portal." Try to point to a place where the user can view our download the source data directly (instead of a dashboard).
* `meta_from_source`: Even if you have access to a metadata file, you may want to look at the dashboards, landing pages, and even press releases surrounding the data in order to get important notes about data collection. Look for keywords like "Notes", "disclaimers", and any blocks of text in visualizations. We would like to scrape these automatically if possible. You may need to use a different process than the process used to fetch the data itself. See [Scraping Techniques](#scraping-techniques) for ideas. The default value if no metadata is available is the empty string `""`.
* `meta_from_paypd`: This field is for our use, to note any oddities transforming the source data to our data model. See [Non-Number Values](#non-number-values) for an example. The default value if no metadata is available is the empty string `""`.

2. __Series__: Timeseries for cases, deaths, and tests  
Below is the data model for the `series` object, containing three keys: `cases`, `deaths`, and `tests`. Each series is an ordered array or list of new counts by day, and cumulative counts to date.  
The main thing to note here is that some counties do not report cumulative counts directly, and some do. If a county does report cumulative counts, it could be an indication that the cumulative datapoint is not simply a sum over the daily new counts. For example, perhaps some patients who were counted in the daily count are later reclassified to a different county for the cumulative count. Look for notes and disclaimers around case totals, and include these in the `meta_from_source` field. If a county does report cumulative counts, we want to reflect the numbers they are directly reporting. Only sum over the daily new counts if cumulative counts are not directly reported.  

For `series` and `deaths`, no datapoint should have a value of -1, since we are only including dates for which the county provides data.  

For `tests`, set the series to the empty list `[]` if the county does not provide testing data. If they only provide total numbers to date, grab those numbers for our cumulative data points. __Add logic to your scraper to append future entries to the existing list, so that we can begin constructing a time-series__. If they leave out pending tests, leave the pending fields as -1, and note that pending tests are excluded in the `meta_from_source` field.

``` 
"series": {
        "cases": [
            { "date": "yyyy-mm-dd", "cases": -1, "cumul_cases": -1},
            { "date": "yyyy-mm-dd", "cases": -1, "cumul_cases": -1 }
       ],
        "deaths": [
            { "date": "yyyy-mm-dd", "deaths": -1, "cumul_deaths": -1 },
            { "date": "yyyy-mm-dd", "deaths": -1, "cumul_deaths": -1}
        ],
        "tests": [
            {
                "date": "yyyy-mm-dd",
                "tests": -1,
                "positive": -1,
                "negative": -1,
                "pending": -1,
                "cumul_tests": -1,
                "cumul_pos": -1,
                "cumul_neg": -1,
                "cumul_pend": -1
            },
            {
                "date": "yyyy-mm-dd",
                "tests": -1,
                "positive": -1,
                "negative": -1,
                "pending": -1,
                "cumul_tests": -1,
                "cumul_pos": -1,
                "cumul_neg": -1,
                "cumul_pend": -1
            }
        ]
    }
```

3. __Case Totals and Death Totals__  
Below are the tabulations we are making by gender, age group, race/ethnicity, and transmission category for cases and deaths. Note that `death_totals` also has a table for underlying conditions (count of deaths by number of underlying conditions). These are the most valuable datapoints that we can offer, since they are not captured in readily available data, and it is not easy to aggregate them over a regional level. They are also the datapoints that are most likely to change and most difficult to standardize across counties. Please see discussions below on [Race and Ethnicity](#race-ethnicity), [Age Group](#age-group), [Gender](#gender) and [Amending the Data Model](#amending-the-data-model).
```
    "death_totals":{
        "gender": {
            "female": -1,
            "male": -1,
            "mtf": -1,
            "ftm": -1,
            "other": -1,
            "unknown": -1
        },
        "age_group": {},
        "race_eth": {
            "African_Amer": -1,
            "Asian": -1,
            "Latinx_or_Hispanic": -1,
            "Native_Amer":-1,
            "Multiple_Race":-1,
            "Other": -1,
            "Pacific_Islander":-1,
            "White":-1,
            "Unknown":-1
            "Multi_or_Other": -1 
        },
        "underlying_cond": {
            "none":-1,
            "greater_than_1" : -1,
            "unknown": -1
        },
        "transmission_cat": {
            "community":-1,
            "from_contact":-1,
            "unknown":-1
        }
    }
```
4. __Population__
At a later date, we will update the scrapers to get demographics for each county's population from the [2018 ACS](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/). These will be stored in the `population_totals` field.  
The fields will be used for normalizing the county case and death tabulations, and are reproduced below. The County categories are likely to have more specific gender catgories, different age brackets, and a flattening of race x ethnicity, compared to the ACS. It is an outstanding question as to how we will fit the ACS to the structure of our data model. 
```
"population_totals": {
        "total_pop": -1,
        "gender": {
            "female": -1,
            "male": -1,
            "mtf": -1,
            "ftm": -1,
            "other": -1,
            "unknown": -1
        },
        "age_group": [
            {"group": "18_and_younger", "raw_count": -1 }, 
            {"group": "18_to_30", "raw_count": -1 },
            {"group": "31_to_40", "raw_count": -1 },
            {"group": "41_to_50", "raw_count": -1 },
            {"group": "51_to_60", "raw_count": -1 },
            {"group": "61_to_70", "raw_count": -1 },
            {"group": "71_to_80", "raw_count": -1 },
            {"group": "81_and_older", "raw_count": -1 }
        ],
        "race_eth": {
            "African_Amer": -1,
            "Asian": -1,
            "Latinx_or_Hispanic": -1,
            "Native_Amer":-1,
            "Multiple_Race":-1,
            "Other": -1,
            "Pacific_Islander":-1,
            "White":-1,
            "Unknown":-1
        }
    }
```

6. __Inmate Data__

Data collection is pending resolution of #108.

```
    "inmates": {
        "cases": -1,
        "deaths": -1
    }
```

6. __Hospitalization Data__

California COVID-19 hospitalization data is retrieved separately from the the
[California Health and Human Services Open Data Portal
(CHHS)](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/covid-19-hospital-data#). The keys for the  top-level data points `name`, `update_time`, `source_url`, `meta_from_source`, and `meta_from_baypd` are the same as the model described above. However, the structure of the data for `meta_from_source` and `series` differs. The model for the hospitalization data is in [hospitals_data_model.json](./hospitals_data_model.json).

`meta_from_source` holds a list of dicts describing each field in the data, provided directly from CHHS. Each dict, except for the first describing the `_id` field, has the keys `info`, `type`, and `id`. Here is an example:

```
    "meta_from_source": [
        {
            "type": "int",
            "id": "_id"
        },
        {
            "info": {
                "notes": "The County where the hospital is located. None of the consolidated reporters had hospitals in different counties.",
                "type_override": "",
                "label": "County"
            },
            "type": "text",
            "id": "county"
        }

        -- snip --
```

The `series` object is a dictionary keyed by the machine-friendly formatted county name (e.g. "san_francisco"), with values being a list of flat dictionaries with with each of the fields described in `meta_from_source`, one for each day on which an observation was made. As described above, null or default values are represented as `-1`.

```
        {
            "icu_covid_confirmed_patients": -1,
            "icu_suspected_covid_patients": -1,
            "hospitalized_covid_patients": -1,
            "hospitalized_suspected_covid_patients": -1,
            "icu_available_beds": -1,
            "county": "Name1 Name2",
            "hospitalized_covid_confirmed_patients": -1,
            "_id": -1,
            "all_hospital_beds": -1,
            "date": "yyyy-mm-dd"
        }
```

The `name` value should always be `CA COVID-19 Hospitalization Data`.

## Scraping Techniques
Examples:  
  * Scraping notes from a list of dashboards with Selenium and Beautiful Soup: [get_notes(), in alameda_county.py](./alameda_county.py)

## Timezone  
Here are some places to search for timezone info.
* ArcGIS: On a feature service layer, try [editFieldsInfo.dateFieldsTemeReference](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/layer-feature-service-.htm#GUID-20D36DF4-F13A-4B01-AA05-D642FA455EB6)

## Non-Number Values
Our data model only allows for numbers for datapoints. You have to translate all datapoints from the source county from either a non-negative number, or -1 to indicate that data is not available. However, you may see a non-number value as a value for a datapoint, and the value can't meaningfully be translated to a non-negative number or -1(it's not just a string representation of a number, or 'null' or 'NA'). For example, Alameda county was storing some datapoints as the string "<10" to indicate that the number of cases was between [0,10). In that case, we automatically populate`meta_from_baypd`with a string of notes to indicate where "<10" occurs, and we translate all those occurences to -1.

## Amending the Data Model
We aim to not lose any detail in translating the source data from the county to our data model. You may find datapoints that our current data model does not track. For example, most counties were tracking non-binary and non-cis genders all under "Other Gender", so an early iteration of our data model followed suit with only "Male, "Female" and "Other". Alameda County later added columns for "MTF" and "FTM", so we amended to model to reflect that. It's not a complete picture (let's all keep an eye out for non-binary and in-transition), and there are issues with having different gender classes for trans-people, but basically we want to be as detailed as the most detailed county. Even if the new categories have null values, we want to make space for them if they're being differentiated at the county level. If you notice new categories, please make PR to amend [_data_model.json](./_data_model.json).  
Scraper authors, please keep an eye out for amendments to the data model.

# Race and Ethnicity
We need to collapse counties that report race and ethnicity into one race/ethnicity dimension. This section will be updated pending information about San Francisco County's methods for reporting race and ethnicity.

The category "Multi_or_Other" was included because Marin rolls up the numbers from "Multi" and "Other" into one. Please note that this category is not relevant for counties that report 'Multiple Race' and 'Other Race' separately.

# Gender
One future potential issue is that some counties still lump non-binary and cis-gender people under "Other", and other counties have started to differentiate. Our data model would ideally match the most detailed county's gender categories. A county with only the "Other" county would have the value of -1 for the non male/female categories, indicating that they are not collecting that information. However, this means that our `"Other"` category would not be internally comparable or consistent. The `"Other"` category for a county that has "Male, Female, Other, MTF, FTM" as separate datapoints should really be called `"Other - not MTF, not FTM"` and is not comparable to the `"Other"` category for a county that only has "Male, Female, Other".

That might be ok since most of our visualizations will be at the county level. If we want to visualize gender category impact at the regional level, we will have to decide if we want to sum over the non Female/Male categories to be comparable to the most general counties.

# Age Group

The county data model does not specify standard age groups. This is because counties bucket age groups differently, and we would lose a lot of detail in order to sum the age-groups into standard buckets that would fit all counties. Our solution is to capture the age group data just as the county is reporting it. Please be sure to use the age group table provided by the county.  
Below is a snapshot of the age group brackets per county as of April 29, 2020. These may have changed, please inspect your county source. Note that the brackets may also vary by cases and deaths.
