    Base class for news scrapers. Common scraping/news feed functionality used
    across multiple counties should be implemented here. This class should be
    inherited and never used directly.

    To run a scraper, first instantiate it, then call `scrape()`:
    >>> class SomeCounty(NewsScraper):
    >>>     ...
    >>> scraper = SomeCounty()
    >>> news_feed = scraper.scrape()

    Classes inheriting from this should set ``START_URL`` to the URL from which
    scraping should start, then implement `parse_page()`, which returns a list
    of news items given some HTML.
