    Scrape official county COVID-related news from San Mateo County. It's based
    on the RSS feed from the County Manager's Office (CMO), though the items
    are cleaned up a bit for readability and to fit with the format of the rest
    of out feeds.

    There are some other sources that might be useful to look into here:
    - The county health office has health orders and health officer statements:
      https://smchealth.org/post/health-officer-statements-and-orders-0
    - The county health office also has "local news," but it’s much less timely
      and detailed than the CMO office's press releases. (Actually, it looks
      like a subset.)
      https://smchealth.org/post/local-news-you-need
    - The Joint Information Center (JIC) has a bunch of stuff, but ultimately
      just shows the CMO press releases for news:
      https://cmo.smcgov.org/jic
