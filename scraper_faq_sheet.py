"""
Grabs data from the 'FAQ Content' CSV and turns it into nice JSON: a main faq object containing an array of Section objects, each Section Object in turn holding an array of Question objects consisting of question, answer and related link/s, as so:
    [
        {
          'q': 'What are the symptoms of COVID-19?',
          'a': 'Symptoms of COVID-19 include coughing and shortness of breath. Additionally, a person showing two or more of the following symptoms may have the virus: fever, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell.',
          'url': 'https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html'
        },
    .
    .
    .
    ]
    etc
In addition to an array of Question objects, each Section incorporates its title and a 'last updated' date value. For the Python intermediary stage (between CSV stream  and JSON) we will create a hierarchy of nested dictionaries and lists equivalent to the JSON objects and arrays.
